# Predictive Modelling for Patient Re admission - Long Stay Prediction
Predictive Modelling for Patient Readmission by extraction and analysis of High-granularity data from notes.
This project performs analysis on clinical notes data.

You can find the code and dataset on GitHub: [GitHub Repository Link](https://github.com/Jyotheekiran/Patient-Readmission/)
# Large Dataset

Due to size limitations, the `noteevents.csv` file is too large to be stored directly in this repository.

You can download the file from the following link:

I am dividing the work into three distinct notebooks to ensure clarity, organization, and reproducibility of our research. Each notebook has a dedicated role in the overall workflow:

**1. Data Exploration (data_exploration.ipynb)**

**2. Model Building and Training (modeling.ipynb)**

**3. Model Interpretation Using LIME and SHAP (lime_shap_analysis.ipynb)**

and I have also uploaded their html files.
